# Going: Open Source Infrastructure for Fair Commerce

**Going** is a decentralized commerce protocol that fixes the extractive models of current e-commerce. We give power back to users with a fair 3% commission and a unique rewards system where escrowed funds generate staking yield for both the buyer and seller.

## ðŸ’¡ About The Project

Our project, "Going", is designed to help merchants, especially small ones, to make more money and build a more equitable relationship with their customers. We are building a peer-to-peer marketplace on Solana featuring a "Yield-Bearing Escrow" system. When a purchase is made, the funds are staked in safe liquid staking protocols, and the yield generated is distributed back to the users as a reward token ($G).

Our technical architecture and security practices are guided by respected Solana community member and hackathon judge, Juan Marchetto.

## ðŸ”‘ Our Core Principles

1.  **Fairness:** A sustainable, low-commission model (3%) that allows sellers to thrive.
2.  **Ownership:** A rewards system ($G) that gives users a stake in the ecosystem's success.
3.  **Transparency:** An open-source protocol that anyone can inspect, use, and build upon.
